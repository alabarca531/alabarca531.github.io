	<h1>Hello! Welcome to my very bad webpage. Development is nowhere near done.</h1>
	<p>I am a first year at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Physics and Astronomy, and Computer Science. I hopefully will also have minors in both math and music. As a result of schoolwork, this website is very preliminary and not finalized in any way, shape, and or form.</p>
